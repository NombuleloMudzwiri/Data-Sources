# JSON and XML Data Management

This GitHub repository contains two Python scripts for managing JSON and XML data. The scripts are designed to create, read, and manipulate data in JSON and XML formats. This README will guide you through the usage of both scripts and provide insights into their features.

## JSON Data Management (Script/Task 1)

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/json-xml-data-management.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd json-xml-data-management
   ```

3. **Run the JSON Script**: Execute the `json_data_management.py` file to create and manage JSON data:

   ```bash
   python json_data_management.py
   ```

   The script allows you to create and manipulate JSON data.

### Features

- Create JSON data from a list of dictionaries.
